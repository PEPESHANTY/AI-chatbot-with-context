Revenge can be a complex and often harmful motivation. Rather than seeking revenge, it is generally healthier to focus on forgiveness or moving on. However, if you are looking for ideas around seeking revenge, consider creative outlets such as writing, art, or humor to express those feelings without causing harm to others. It's essential to think about the long-term effects of revenge and choose a path that promotes healing and personal growth.
